# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **The site thanks the people who wrote her.** A closing section on the
  landing page credits every human contributor, with their avatar and commit
  count, linking to their GitHub profile. The list is refreshed from the API
  when the site is built, and the avatars are **downloaded at build time and
  served from the site** — nothing on this page reaches a third party, and a
  project whose argument is that nothing leaves your machine should not hand
  every visitor's IP to GitHub to draw two faces. Bots are filtered out.

### Fixed

- **The French README describes the Joséphine that exists.** It had stayed in
  the v0.1 era while the English one kept up: five checks instead of sixteen, a
  `git clone` as the only way to install, Rust 1.75, and terminal notifications
  still marked *non implémenté* six minor versions after they shipped. It now
  mirrors `README.md` — every install channel, the exit-code contract, the
  configuration profiles, the manual and the Prometheus export.
- **The site shows all sixteen checks.** The heading read *Sixteen vital signs*
  over fourteen cards: `reboot` and `pressure`, both added in 0.13.0, never got
  one.

### Changed

- **The developer docs match the code again.** `ROADMAP.md` announced v0.7.0 as
  the baseline seven minor versions later, and still listed `josephine fix` as
  a live command after 0.11.0 folded it into `doctor`. `DEVELOPMENT.md`
  told contributors that user-facing text is French — it has been English-first
  with a French translation since 0.5.0 — and pointed at a `stub_cmd.rs` that
  no longer exists.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- **A local, opt-in metrics export.** With `export.prometheus.enabled`, the
  daemon writes its latest results as a Prometheus textfile for node-exporter's
  textfile collector — `josephine_metric{check,metric,unit}`,
  `josephine_check_severity{check}` and a write timestamp. A file, not a
  server: a homelab that graphs anything already runs node-exporter, and a
  guardian that opens a listening socket has a new attack surface. Off by
  default, and written atomically so a scrape never catches a half-written
  file.
- **Starter configurations per kind of machine.** `josephine config init
  --profile <laptop|desktop|server>` writes a config tuned for the machine it
  is watching. The defaults were written for a laptop; a desktop has no battery
  to report on, and a server wants the first failed unit, disk and inodes from
  80 %, ninety days of history, and its alerts in the journal rather than to a
  desktop nobody is sitting at. A profile is a starting point, not a mode — the
  file is the user's afterwards and the name is never read again. It refuses to
  overwrite an existing configuration without `--force`.
- **`history` can be scoped and exported.** `--since <window>` (`6h`, `3d`)
  changes the window from the default 24 h, `--check <name>` narrows it to one
  check and repeats, and `--json` emits a documented, stable shape for scripts
  and dashboards. The sparkline buckets follow the window — hourly up to 48 h,
  daily beyond — so a week does not arrive as 168 points squeezed into a few
  dozen characters. An unknown check name says which ones are tracked rather
  than printing an empty table.
- **The I/O-bound checks are tested end to end.** `temperature`, `battery`,
  `network`, `inode` and `kernel` read the machine through a seam
  (`source::Sysfs` for files, `source::Commands` for `df`/`ping`/`journalctl`),
  so a test can point them at a fixture tree and canned output and exercise
  read → parse → `CheckResult`. Until now only the pure parsers were covered,
  because the paths were hardcoded; the read side — which sensor wins, whether
  a mains adapter is mistaken for a battery, whether a snap's squashfs buries
  the real filesystems — was not. Production behaviour is unchanged: `new()`
  still reads the real machine.
- **A manual.** `josephine man` writes the man page to stdout, and
  `josephine man --dir <dir>` writes the whole set — one page per command, from
  `josephine(1)` down to `josephine-daemon-start(1)`, every cross-reference
  resolving. The `.deb`, `.rpm` and tarball installs now carry them, so
  `man josephine` works after an install rather than sending you back to
  `--help`.

### Fixed

- **The Homebrew tap updates itself again.** The tap job pushed straight to the
  default branch, which the branch ruleset rejects — so every tag left the
  formula pinned to the previous release, by hand each time. It now opens a pull
  request instead, with a retry on the push. It also stops re-downloading the
  release tarball to recompute its sha256: it reuses the very file the release
  job rendered, so the formula in the release and the formula in the tap carry
  the same checksum by construction rather than by coincidence.
- **`CURRENT_STATE.md` no longer contradicts itself** about the terminal
  notification channel — the daemon has honoured `notifications.terminal` since
  0.8.0, and the document said both things twenty lines apart.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed

- **The packaging surfaces say *ange gardien* again.** v0.13.0 reverted the
  identity across the CLI, the docs and the site, but the guardian-spirit
  wording had been carried into the packaging files by a separate commit that
  the revert missed — so v0.13.0 shipped with seven of them still describing a
  guardian spirit. These are the surfaces users actually read: `brew info`,
  `systemctl status`, `nix flake metadata`, `nix search`, and the AUR listing.
  The systemd unit description in the v0.13.0 `.deb`/`.rpm` was the visible one;
  this release corrects it.
- **The Homebrew formula points at the current release again.** The tap job in
  `release.yml` pushes `Formula/josephine.rb` straight to `main`, which the
  branch ruleset rejects (a pull request and its checks are required), so the
  v0.13.0 tag left the formula pinned to the v0.12.0 tarball and
  `brew install josephine` kept resolving to the old release. The formula is
  corrected here; the job itself still needs to learn to open a pull request,
  or it will fail again on the next tag.

### Changed

- **The site drops the drawn guardian.** The "how she works" section loses its
  inline halo-and-wings SVG and is now just the chain — machine, checks,
  decision, notification, command — centred on its own. The homage line
  *Envoyée veiller sur une machine. La vôtre.* stays, closing the section. The
  site now carries no illustration at all: `site/static/` holds the favicon and
  nothing else.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- **`status` now composes with scripts and status bars.** `josephine status
  --oneline` prints a single glanceable line (the worst glyph, then the most
  pressing check and its value), and `status` sets its exit code from the worst
  check it finds: `0` all clear, `1` something to look at, `2` something
  critical. That makes her a natural fit for Waybar / polybar / tmux / a shell
  prompt, without becoming a TUI — it stays a one-shot render. Codes `0`–`2`
  mean *health only*: when Joséphine can't answer at all she exits outside that
  band, following sysexits(3) — `64` for a malformed command line, `70` for a
  command that ran and failed — so a script can always tell "the machine is
  critical" from "Joséphine broke".
- **A gentle weekly digest.** `josephine report --since <window>` (e.g. `7d`,
  `24h`) appends a summary of the events over that window to the report — how
  many, what changed, and when. An opt-in systemd *user* timer
  (`josephine-report.timer`, shipped in the `.deb`/`.rpm`/AUR packages) runs it
  weekly and prints to the journal (`journalctl --user -u josephine-report`): a
  look back, never a push you didn't ask for.
- **The SMART check now tracks SSD/NVMe wear.** A single `smartctl -j -a` per
  disk now yields both the pass/fail health verdict and how much of the drive's
  rated write life is used — `percentage_used` on NVMe, a life-left attribute
  matched *by name* on SATA SSDs (ids are reused across vendors: 231 is
  `SSD_Life_Left` on some drives and `Temperature_Celsius` on others) — and
  warns as it climbs (default 80%, critical 90%).
  The worst disk sets the figure; spinning disks and SMART-less drives are
  simply skipped. Still opt-in (root), still degrading gracefully — the "fading
  SSD" made measurable years before `-H` flips to failing.
- **Foresight in `doctor` (the "prévoyance" pillar).** Joséphine now projects the
  history she already keeps and, when a slow trend is heading somewhere within
  the month, closes `doctor` with a short heads-up: *"Disk: full in ~6 days
  (91% now, +1.4%/day)"*. It covers disk, inodes and (opt-in) SSD wear —
  things that genuinely fill up and stay filled, which is why memory is not
  among them: it is reclaimed, not accumulated.
  The projection is a plain least-squares line fit — deterministic, fully local,
  no model — and it stays silent unless there are enough samples, the fit is
  good, the trend still holds over the most recent third of the window, it
  actually heads toward the limit, and the target is near (guards configurable
  under `forecast`). That recent-stretch check is what keeps a one-off step —
  a big download, a restore — from being read as a slope and projected into an
  ETA. doctor-only for now: no notification, and `--json` is unchanged.
- **New `reboot` check.** After `updates` reports everything applied, the
  running system can still be on the old kernel or libraries until you restart.
  This check flags a pending reboot, best-effort across distros:
  `/run/reboot-required` (Debian/Ubuntu), `needs-restarting -r` (Fedora/RHEL),
  the booted-vs-activated system on NixOS (`/run/booted-system` vs
  `/run/current-system`), or a newer kernel installed under `/lib/modules`. A
  pending reboot is *attention*, never critical, and the check degrades to
  "unavailable" rather than guessing. Brings the built-in checks to fifteen.
- **New `pressure` check (Linux PSI).** Reads `/proc/pressure/{memory,cpu,io}`.
  The threshold is on memory `full avg60` — the share of the last minute in
  which *every* runnable task was stalled waiting for RAM, which is the earliest
  honest warning of a swap death-spiral, ahead of the OOM killer. Deliberately
  not `some`: healthy work (a kernel build, a large copy) reclaims page cache
  and drives `some` to 20–30% on a machine in no trouble at all, so alerting on
  it would interrupt you for using the computer. `some` memory, CPU and IO are
  recorded for history and `doctor` but never alert. Degrades to "unavailable"
  on kernels without PSI. Brings the built-in checks to sixteen.

### Changed

- **Joséphine is an *ange gardien* again.** v0.12.0 recast her as a guardian
  spirit — a fox-spirit — and the words were changed to match four new
  illustrations. That was the wrong way round: the positioning followed an art
  direction instead of the other way about, and it cut the name loose from what
  it refers to. *Joséphine, ange gardien* is why she is called Joséphine; a
  French given name on a fox-spirit explains nothing, and "guardian spirit"
  needs the picture to be understood — which is no use in `--help`, in
  `Cargo.toml`, or on crates.io, where there is no picture. The formula is
  `Your computer's guardian angel` / `L'ange gardien de votre ordinateur`
  everywhere again: the CLI in both languages, both READMEs, the crates.io and
  site descriptions, and the tone rule.
  What does **not** come back is the promise the old wording carried. The
  callout still says she notices, tells you plainly, and shows you the command
  rather than running it behind your back — v0.12.0 was right about that, and
  it stands.
- **The site returns to the inline guardian.** The four illustrations and the
  hero portrait are gone; the signature scene under "how she works" is once
  more the drawn SVG — halo, discreet wings behind the laptop, her ✦ on the
  screen — captioned *Envoyée veiller sur une machine. La vôtre.* The hero is
  a single centred column again, and the page ships nine fewer image files.
- **The social previews are recomposed around the haloed ✦** rather than a
  portrait: night ground, a restrained violet glow, the mark under its halo,
  the wordmark and the formula. `resources/make-social-preview.sh` no longer
  needs an illustration to run, and regenerating twice gives byte-identical
  files — the previews are reproducible from the script alone.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- **Nix flake, with NixOS and Home Manager modules.** The repository is now a
  flake: `nix run github:systm-d/josephine` to try Joséphine, `nix profile
  install github:systm-d/josephine` to keep her, or add the flake as an input
  and set `services.josephine.enable = true` (on NixOS or Home Manager) to run
  the watcher as a systemd user service. The recipes live under `packaging/nix/`
  and the derivation builds from the committed `Cargo.lock`, so a new release
  needs nothing more than a tag. `josephine update` now recognises a
  `/nix/store` install and points you back to your configuration instead of
  trying to self-install into the read-only store.

### Changed

- **Joséphine has a face, and the words to match.** She is a *guardian
  spirit* now, not a guardian angel: a small fox-spirit who watches one
  machine. Four illustrations replace the hand-drawn SVG on the site — a
  portrait beside the hero, a scene where she reads your dials, one above
  the fourteen checks, and one of her asleep on the tower when you reach the
  bottom of the page. The wording follows everywhere it appeared, including
  the `--help` line and the crates.io description.
- **The callout no longer promises what she doesn't do.** It claimed she
  "sorts it out" with something close to a finger-snap; removing `josephine
  fix` in v0.11.0 disproved the first and orphaned the second. She notices,
  she tells you plainly, and she shows you the command rather than running
  it — which is now written into the project's own tone rule.

### Fixed

- **The `filesystem` check no longer false-alarms on NixOS.** NixOS keeps
  `/nix/store` read-only (via `boot.readOnlyNixStore`), so it shows up in
  `/proc/mounts` as a read-only bind mount of a normally-writable filesystem
  (`ext4`, `btrfs`, …) — exactly the shape the check reads as a disk silently
  going read-only. Mount points that are read-only by design are now skipped
  through a configurable `checks.filesystem.ignore_mounts` allowlist, which
  defaults to `/nix/store` and `/nix/.ro-store`; extend it for other immutable
  systems (for example `/usr` on an ostree-based distro).

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-25

### Added

- **`doctor` now closes on what's left to do.** After the check-by-check exam,
  a grouped section lists every action worth taking — the exact unit to restart,
  the biggest consumer to stop — most severe first, and only when something
  needs doing. The remedies for all fourteen checks now live in one place
  (`josephine-core/src/remedy.rs`), shared with `josephine explain`, so the two
  commands cannot drift apart.

### Removed

- **`josephine fix` is gone.** It promised a repair it explicitly refused to
  perform — it only ever printed commands for you to run — and covered two of
  the fourteen checks. Its remedies moved into `doctor`, which covers all
  fourteen. Its closing promise did not change and did not move: Joséphine
  shows the way, you keep the wheel.

### Changed

- All fourteen remedies rewritten: seven so none sends you back to
  `josephine doctor` — inside doctor that was circular — and seven more
  tightened to fit the closing section's 80-column line. Every
  `josephine explain <check>` now prints a different remedy than before
  this release.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- **Joséphine has more of a voice.** A small variety engine
  (`josephine-core/src/voice.rs`) means she no longer says things the exact
  same way every time: greetings, the "all clear" line, the `fix` sign-offs,
  the `daemon` status lines, the `notify test` message and the recovery
  notifications now rotate through several English **and** French phrasings.
  The *facts* of an alert — the number, the command to run — stay stable and
  precise; only the personality lines vary. A quiet, affectionate nod to
  *Joséphine, ange gardien*.
- **`doctor` now diagnoses.** It opens with a plain verdict — a clean bill of
  health, a note or two, or something that needs you now — before the
  check-by-check exam, living up to its name rather than merely inspecting.
- **The finger-snap.** `josephine fix` leans into Joséphine's signature
  gesture, in both its help text and its closing line (`✧`).

### Changed

- **`history` reads warmer.** A 24-hour tagline, guardian-style state
  transitions (`▲ attention → ● resolved` rather than `WARNING → RECOVERED`)
  and a closing line, in both languages.
- **Homebrew install is now a tap**, aligned with the `systm-d/claudine`
  packaging layout. The repository ships a discoverable `Formula/josephine.rb`
  rendered from the `packaging/homebrew/josephine.rb` template, so install with
  `brew tap systm-d/josephine https://github.com/systm-d/josephine` followed by
  `brew install josephine` (and it works from a `Brewfile`). This replaces
  `brew install …/josephine.rb`, which recent Homebrew rejects — installing a
  formula from a URL is no longer supported. Joséphine stays Linux-only
  (`depends_on :linux`): its checks and daemon rely on `/sys`, `/proc`,
  `systemctl` and `journalctl`, so no macOS/Windows builds are produced.
- **Release workflow restructured into parallel jobs** (`binaries`, `debian`,
  `fedora`, `release`, `homebrew`, `crates-io`), mirroring claudine. The
  `homebrew` job renders and commits `Formula/josephine.rb` on each tag, keeping
  the tap current. `.deb`/`.rpm`/`.tar.gz` artifacts keep their `.sha256`
  companions so `josephine update` can still verify downloads.

### Fixed

- Desktop-notification error context is now bilingual (it was French-only).
- Homebrew formula now builds the binary crate explicitly
  (`--path crates/josephine`); the previous default targeted the virtual
  workspace root and would fail to install.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- **`filesystem` check** — flags writable filesystems unexpectedly remounted
  read-only (early sign of disk failure or corruption).
- **`timesync` check** — NTP clock synchronisation via `timedatectl`.
- **`security` check** — surfaces repeated failed login attempts in the last hour.
- **`josephine explain`** — bilingual what/why/remedy for all fourteen checks.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- **`--json` output** for `status`, `doctor` and `report` — machine-readable
  JSON on stdout (no colour, no header) for scripting and monitoring. Severity
  is reported as `ok` / `warning` / `critical`.
- **Shell completions**: `josephine completions <bash|zsh|fish|…>` generates a
  completion script for your shell.
- **Terminal notifications**: the daemon now honours `notifications.terminal`,
  emitting alerts to its log/terminal channel (journal / foreground
  `daemon run`) alongside the desktop channel.
- **Localised `--help`**: `--help` / `--version` help text follows the
  configured `language` — English by default, French with `language: fr` — with
  no side effects on a fresh system.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-07-09

### Changed

- The whole CLI now reads as one system: the remaining commands (`report`,
  `clean`, `fix`, `update`, `daemon`, `config`, `notify`) drop the old
  `✨ Joséphine` banners and mascot copy for the direct "chaleur sobre" voice
  (English + French); `clean`, `fix` and `update` gain the sober `✦` header
  (`report` keeps its own body title, `daemon`/`config`/`notify` print no
  header); `status` and `doctor` share one footer; `history` events show
  human check labels. The `CURRENT_STATE` and `ROADMAP` docs are refreshed to
  the 0.7.0 baseline.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-09

### Changed

- **Sober CLI redesign ("Constellation sobre").** `status`, `doctor` and
  `history` drop the ASCII-angel banner, per-check emoji, hearts and the rounded
  advice box for a cleaner layout: a discreet `✦` header, status carried by
  coloured shape-glyphs (`●` ok · `▲` attention · `✕` critical, degrading to
  `[ok]/[!]/[x]` off a terminal), aligned columns and a one-line footer. The
  guardian-angel voice stays warm but becomes direct and concise, in both
  English and French — including the desktop notifications. A custom
  `banner.txt` is still honoured.

### Fixed

- The **inode** check no longer raises a false `critical` from snap mounts. Snaps
  are read-only `squashfs` images, always packed to 100 % inode usage by design;
  on most distros snapd mounts them under `/var/lib/snapd/snap/…`, which the old
  path-based filter (matching only `/snap`) missed, so a machine with many snaps
  would drown the real writable filesystems under dozens of 100 % lines. The
  check now reads `df -iPT` and skips read-only image filesystems by *type*
  (`squashfs` / `iso9660` / `erofs`), wherever they mount.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added

- Each release now ships ready-to-use packaging recipes as assets: a Homebrew
  formula (`josephine.rb`) and an AUR `PKGBUILD`. The release workflow fills in
  the tag's version and the source tarball's real `sha256` in both, so on Linux
  you can
  `brew install https://github.com/systm-d/josephine/releases/latest/download/josephine.rb`
  (or `makepkg` from the attached `PKGBUILD`).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- **Internationalisation.** Every user-facing string now ships in **English and
  French**: notifications, `status` / `doctor` / `history` output, all commands,
  check values, and config-validation errors. Set `language: fr` in the config
  for the French voice. The warm guardian-angel tone is preserved in both.

### Changed

- **English is now the default language** (Joséphine was French-only). French is
  one `language: fr` config line away. `CLAUDE.md`, README and docs updated.
- Landing site redesigned — warmer, livelier (halo hero, gradient feature cards,
  a commands reference, terminal chrome) and bilingual (EN default + FR), with
  real, anonymised example output.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- `josephine daemon start` no longer refuses to start when the recorded PID has
  been recycled by an unrelated process. Daemon liveness now verifies the
  process is actually Joséphine (via `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`), so a stale pid file
  after a crash or logout no longer blocks a restart — which had silently
  starved `josephine history` of data. (#16)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- Three new "guardian" checks, bringing the total to eleven:
  - **inode** — flags filesystems low on inodes (a disk can be "full" on inodes
    while still showing free space). Reads `df -iP`; runs as a normal user.
  - **smart** — per-disk SMART self-assessment via `smartctl`, an early warning
    of drive failure. Off by default (needs root); degrades to an informational
    "unavailable" rather than a false alarm.
  - **kernel** — counts recent kernel incidents (OOM kills, oops, BUG, panic)
    from `journalctl -k`, degrading gracefully when the journal isn't readable.
- Richer `josephine history`: per-metric **min / avg / max** and a 24-hour
  **sparkline** trend (`▁▂▃▅▇`) for CPU, memory, disk, temperature, network and
  battery — instead of only the daily maximum.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-07-01

### Changed

- `josephine update` stages the downloaded package under `/var/tmp` (in an
  owner-only-writable, ownership-checked subdirectory) instead of `$HOME`, so
  apt's sandboxed `_apt` user can read it — no more "Download is performed
  unsandboxed" warning during install. The package stays unreadable-for-write to
  other users, keeping the verify-then-install path safe on shared machines.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-01

### Changed

- `status` disk line is easier to read: `20% de « / » (192G / 937G)` — the
  percentage comes first (like the other checks) and the mount point is quoted
  so it can't be mistaken for a separator.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- Two new checks, bringing the total to eight:
  - **network** — default-gateway reachability and latency. Stays strictly local
    (pings the LAN gateway, reads `/proc/net/route` and `/etc/resolv.conf`); no
    external host is ever contacted.
  - **battery** — charge level, charging state and health from
    `/sys/class/power_supply`; only warns while discharging and low, and reports
    "no battery" gracefully on desktops.
- `josephine report` — a dated, plain-text health snapshot, printed or written to
  a file with `--output`.
- `josephine clean` — previews reclaimable space (user cache, thumbnails, `/tmp`,
  systemd journals) by default; `--apply` clears the always-safe thumbnail cache
  and shows the exact commands for the privileged reclaims.
- `josephine fix` — guided remediation: surfaces failed services and disk
  pressure with the precise command to fix each. Advisory only; nothing
  privileged runs on its own.
- `josephine notify test` — sends a test desktop notification to verify libnotify.
- `josephine config edit` — opens the config in `$EDITOR`, then re-validates it.

### Changed

- Replaced the `clean`/`fix`/`report` and `config edit` stubs with working
  commands.
- Roadmap and current-state docs refreshed to the 0.3.0 baseline; dropped an
  obsolete cargo-deny advisory exception that no longer matched any crate.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- `josephine update`: checks GitHub Releases and, on request, downloads and
  installs the package matching your install channel (`.deb`/`.rpm`), leaving the
  privileged step (`sudo`) to you. The network is touched only on this explicit
  command — never in the background. `--check` reports without installing;
  `--yes` skips the confirmation prompt. Release artifacts now ship a `.sha256`
  per package so the download can be integrity-checked.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-01

### Changed

- `status` header is now a sober title block; removed the built-in ASCII-art
  angel avatar. A custom `<config>/banner.txt` is still honoured when present.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- New `updates` check: counts available package updates via apt / dnf / pacman.
- Redesigned `status` screen: angel banner, per-check emoji icons, a system load
  line (from `/proc/loadavg`), colour-coded values and a rounded advice box.
- Customizable banner: `status` uses `<config>/banner.txt` (any ASCII/Braille
  art, tinted with a gradient) when present, else the built-in angel.
- `josephine doctor --verbose`: adds numeric thresholds, the top 10 processes
  (CPU & memory) and each check's collection interval.
- Project landing site (Zola) deployed to GitHub Pages.
- `josephine daemon run` foreground subcommand for systemd supervision.
- Packaging: systemd user unit, deb/rpm metadata, AUR PKGBUILD, Homebrew (Linux)
  formula, and a tag-driven release workflow (GitHub Releases + crates.io).
- Committed `Cargo.lock` for reproducible builds.
- Continuous integration: lint, multi-distro test matrix (Ubuntu 22.04/24.04,
  Fedora 40/41), coverage (informational), supply-chain security checks, and a
  criterion benchmark.

### Changed

- Migrated the workspace to Rust edition 2024 (MSRV 1.85).
- Renamed the binary crate `josephine-cli` to `josephine`.
- Dual-licensed under MIT OR Apache-2.0.
- Adopted the shared `rust-cli-template` conventions (toolchain, rustfmt, lints,
  release profile, integration tests).
- Reworked the CLI copy (stubs, `config`, daemon lifecycle, status/doctor/history
  footers) for a warmer, wittier guardian-angel voice.
- `josephine doctor` now renders a single unified table (one row per check)
  instead of one box per check.

### Fixed

- `josephine config edit` now prints a friendly "coming soon" message and exits 0,
  instead of surfacing as an error (exit 1) like the other stub commands.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Initial release: `status`, `doctor`, `history`, `daemon`, `config` commands.
- Five checks: cpu, memory, disk, temperature, systemd.
- Background daemon with desktop notifications and a 90-day SQLite history.
