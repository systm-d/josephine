## Up in a minute

Grab a package from the [latest release](https://github.com/systm-d/josephine/releases/latest):

```sh
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo dpkg -i josephine_*_amd64.deb

# Fedora / RHEL
sudo rpm -i josephine-*.x86_64.rpm
```

Prefer to build it yourself? `cargo install --git https://github.com/systm-d/josephine josephine` (Rust 1.85+). On Linux with Homebrew, `brew tap systm-d/josephine https://github.com/systm-d/josephine && brew install josephine` builds from source.

To keep Joséphine watching across reboots, enable the bundled systemd **user** unit:

```sh
systemctl --user enable --now josephine
```

<p class="callout"><strong>Joséphine is a guardian, not a dashboard.</strong> She stays out of your way, keeps her voice calm, and only speaks when it helps — for people who'd rather their computer simply took care of itself.</p>

> Joséphine speaks English by default — set `language: fr` in the config for her French voice. The warm, direct tone is preserved in both.
